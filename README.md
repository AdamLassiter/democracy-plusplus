> “For liberty! For Managed Democracy! For Super Earth!”

**Democracy++** is a *Helldivers 2* companion web app that dares to push the frontiers of freedom itself.  
Earn credits for your heroic service, spend them on stratagems and weaponry, and survive the ever-rising tide of galactic oppression — one procedurally intensifying challenge at a time.

👉 [**Helldivers to Hellpods**](https://adamlassiter.github.io/democracy-plusplus/) and do your part, soldier.


## 🌍 Mission Briefing

Democracy++ is a metagame built for Helldivers who crave **order**, **structure**, and **painful fairness**.  
It introduces a **quest, challenge & shop** system to the Helldivers 2 experience, letting players earn, spend, and suffer in glorious liberation.

While lesser recruits may settle for [helldivers2challenges.com](https://helldivers2challenges.com/), *true patriots* know that balance and challenge are the twin engines of liberty.  
Democracy++ refines that formula — more depth, more math, and more ways to prove your devotion to Super Earth.
